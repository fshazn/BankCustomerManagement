üè¶ BANK CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT

A simple C# console application demonstrating SOLID principles and Entity Framework Core using SQLite.
The application simulates a small banking system where you can manage Customers and their Accounts (Savings / Checking).

FEATURES

  * Add a new customer.
  * View all customers along with their accounts.
  * Add Savings or Checking accounts for a customer.
  * View accounts for a specific customer.
  * All data is stored persistently in a SQLite database (banking.db).

SOLID Principle	How It‚Äôs Applied in This Project

S ‚Äì Single Responsibility	Each class has a single responsibility:
    ‚Ä¢ CustomerService ‚Üí business logic for customers only.
    ‚Ä¢ AccountService ‚Üí business logic for accounts only.
    ‚Ä¢ CustomerRepository ‚Üí database operations for Customer only.
    ‚Ä¢ AccountRepository ‚Üí database operations for Account only.

O ‚Äì Open/Closed	The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
    ‚Ä¢ Account is an abstract class.
    ‚Ä¢ You can create SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, or any new account type without changing existing service code.
    ‚Ä¢ OnModelCreating uses EF Core discriminator to handle new account types automatically.
    
L ‚Äì Liskov Substitution	Subtypes can replace their base types without breaking functionality:
    ‚Ä¢ Anywhere Account is expected, SavingsAccount or CheckingAccount can be used.
    ‚Ä¢ For example, AccountService methods accept Account-derived objects.
    
I ‚Äì Interface Segregation	Clients depend only on methods they use:
    ‚Ä¢ ICustomerRepository contains only customer-related operations.
    ‚Ä¢ IAccountRepository contains only account-related operations.
    ‚Ä¢ Services depend on these small interfaces, not a large, all-encompassing interface.
    
D ‚Äì Dependency Inversion	High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:
    ‚Ä¢ CustomerService depends on ICustomerRepository.
    ‚Ä¢ AccountService depends on IAccountRepository.
    ‚Ä¢ Dependency Injection (DI) container injects concrete implementations (CustomerRepository / AccountRepository) at runtime.
