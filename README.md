üè¶ BankCustomerManagement

A simple C# console application demonstrating SOLID principles and Entity Framework Core using SQLite.
The application simulates a small banking system where you can manage Customers and their Accounts (Savings / Checking).

Features

Add a new customer.

View all customers along with their accounts.

Add Savings or Checking accounts for a customer.

View accounts for a specific customer.

All data is stored persistently in a SQLite database (banking.db).

SOLID Principles in This Project
Principle	How It‚Äôs Applied in This Project
S ‚Äì Single Responsibility	Each class has a single responsibility:
‚Ä¢ CustomerService ‚Üí business logic for customers only.
‚Ä¢ AccountService ‚Üí business logic for accounts only.
‚Ä¢ CustomerRepository ‚Üí database operations for Customer only.
‚Ä¢ AccountRepository ‚Üí database operations for Account only.
O ‚Äì Open/Closed	The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
‚Ä¢ Account is an abstract class.
‚Ä¢ You can create SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, or any new account type without changing existing service code.
‚Ä¢ OnModelCreating uses EF Core discriminator to handle new account types automatically.
L ‚Äì Liskov Substitution	Subtypes can replace their base types without breaking functionality:
‚Ä¢ Anywhere Account is expected, SavingsAccount or CheckingAccount can be used.
‚Ä¢ For example, AccountService methods accept Account-derived objects.
I ‚Äì Interface Segregation	Clients depend only on methods they use:
‚Ä¢ ICustomerRepository contains only customer-related operations.
‚Ä¢ IAccountRepository contains only account-related operations.
‚Ä¢ Services depend on these small interfaces, not a large, all-encompassing interface.
D ‚Äì Dependency Inversion	High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:
‚Ä¢ CustomerService depends on ICustomerRepository.
‚Ä¢ AccountService depends on IAccountRepository.
‚Ä¢ Dependency Injection (DI) container injects concrete implementations (CustomerRepository / AccountRepository) at runtime.
Prerequisites

.NET 8 SDK

A code editor or IDE (Visual Studio 2022 Community recommended or VS Code).

Installation & Running

Clone or download the project.

Open the folder in Visual Studio or VS Code.

Install required NuGet packages:

dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore --version 8.*
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 8.*
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 8.*
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting --version 8.*


Build the project:

dotnet build


Run the project:

dotnet run


You will see the console menu:

=== Bank Menu ===
1. Add Customer
2. Show All Customers
3. Add Account for Customer
4. Show Accounts for Customer
5. Exit
Choose an option:

How It Works

Adding Customers

Enter a name, and EF Core saves it to the database.

Adding Accounts

Choose a customer ID and account type (Savings / Checking).

Enter balance and additional info (interest rate or overdraft).

Viewing Data

Customers and their accounts are loaded using EF Core queries.

Database

A SQLite file (banking.db) is automatically created in the project folder.

EF Core translates C# queries into SQL commands (you might see them logged in the console).
